        <p>
            At least 154 people were killed and over 100 more injured in a crowd surge at packed Halloween festivities in the South Korean capital of Seoul, local officials say.
            At least 26 foreign nationals, including two US citizens, are among the dead. More than a dozen embassies around the globe have confirmed victims from their country.
            The crush took place in the nightlife district of Itaewon. What caused the surge is not clear, but witnesses say partygoers were packed tightly into narrow streets.
            South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has declared a period of national mourning.
